charette en français il quelques années demandé de séjourner dans un petit village de mon choix afin écrire des poèmes j ai choisi la vallée de la missisquoi dans les cantons de l est en québec parce que j aimais la signification du nom donné par les premières nations à la baie beaucoup oiseaux aquatiques déjà je voyais des oiseaux partout dans mes rêves autour de tête derrière les fenêtres je voyais aussi le vent bouger à travers les champs de maïs cette région ramenait aussi à mon amour de la afin de choisir le village de mon séjour j avais pointé mon doigt sur un petit village appelé mystic ce nom attirait j avais aussi découvert une ville homonyme aux où il avait dans un musée une salle dédiée à melville je laisse toujours guider par les coïncidences pour écrire j inventais ores et déjà des liens entre melville et le mystic québécois entre moi prenant des notes dans une cavalier louée et ces défricheurs de territoires réels et fictifs que sont les grands écrivains américains du 19e siècle j imaginais aussi des histoires de diable tournant en rond dans la grange à douze côtés et créais une numérologie intime à moi je chercherais les ponts couverts sur la route les granges rondes construites par des quakers utopiques les maisons à façade victorienne je pensais à la fuite des loyalistes vers le nord aux irlandais catholiques fuyant la famine à tous ces immigrants ayant laissé leurs traces sur le chemin je savais qu en aventurant plus loin aux abords du grand lac memphrémagog je penserais aussi aux déserteurs de la guerre du vietnam je pensais aux abénaquis des premières nations qui ont donné les noms aux lacs et aux rivières à notre ignorance à là où mon séjour commençait j ai compris cependant que j étais sur une route où chaque arrêt menait à un autre je suis entrée dans le bureau du tourisme j ai posé mille questions à une petite historienne de stanbridge station elle indiqué sur la carte où se trouve chemin la deuxième plus belle route du québec je n ai pas jamais appris où se situe la première et je ne suis pas restée à mystic dès que j ai aperçu le vieux cimetière de hunter mills c est la zone frontalière entre le québec et les qui fascinée elle était l illustration de l état dans lequel je trouvais dans l esprit de l errance à la recherche de fantômes les miens ceux des autres à la recherche de mes mots terre promise maison construite pierre après pierre tout au long de vie et c est ainsi qu appelée à séjourner dans un petit village je suis retrouvée à ramasser les grains un chapelet de hameaux dispersés sur le chemin de la frontière le décor que j ai trouvé enchante toujours villages enclavés dans l ombre des montagnes dont le grandeur veillaient sur les lacs longs et les rivières fermes et champs de maïs une mercedes sur quatre blocs à travers le débarras devant une maison à l abandon de vieux cimetières qui surprennent à chaque détour des arbres feuillus érables noyers êtres chênes bouleaux quelques croix de
